We designed our architecture to be open, interoperable, and highly\\nextensible. We launched the CrowdStrike Store, the first open cloud-based application PaaS for cybersecurity, which\\nallows customers to purchase CrowdStrike products and provides an ecosystem of trusted partners and applications for\\nour customers to choose from. We plan to continue investing in the CrowdStrike Store to empower our partners by\\nmaking it easier to build applications and to enable our customers to more easily discover, try, and purchase additional\\ncloud modules from both trusted partners and us.\\n1127/06/2023, 21:47 crwd-20230131\\nhttps://www .sec.gov/Ar chives/edgar/data/1535527/000153552723000008/crwd-20230131.htm 15/161Table of Contents\\nWe have experienced significant growth, with revenue increasing from $1.5 billion in fiscal 2022 to $2.2\\xa0billion in fiscal 2023,',\n",
